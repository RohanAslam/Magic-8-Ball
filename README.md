## :loudspeaker: Introduction

The **Magic 8 Ball** is a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It consists of a spherical object resembling a billiard ball with 20 sides, each with a different message printed on it. The ball is turned over and a message appears at random, revealing the answer to a question or offering advice.

This web-based project allows users to input their questions and receive a randomly generated response from the Magic 8 Ball. It's a fun and interactive way to get some quick answers and have a bit of fun.
